Unable to configure the pawn movement component inside the blueprint of the pawn.

Hi Ufna,

It's not exactly a bug, but it is a limitation of how component templates are stored right now. It's something we want to fix in a future release.

For now, you can change settings in your derived BP by setting them in the user construction script of blueprint B.
