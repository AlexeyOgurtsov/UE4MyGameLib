Functional requirements:
	- Ability to be deactivated with conserving the velocity of the updated component;


Requirement: Movement in coordinate space of the spline.
	- Separate along-spline speed parameter irrespective of the given input vector;
	- Movement with velocity corresponding the given pending input vector and the given Speed
          in the coordinate space of the spline;
	- Movemement with acceleration corresponding the given pending input vector
          in the coordinate space of the spline;

Requirement: Spline-space physics:
	- Add force with spline constraint;
